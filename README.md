# WardenOS Source

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.9.

"WardenOS" is a toolkit developed for the Mothership TTRPG. It includes random table generators, two character builders to create random player characters or "biased" player characters: character classes, loadouts, and skills are chosen based on the randomly generated stats, and the ability to export the results of these generators as PDFs.

This version is the source code, ready to be forked, remixed, and otherwised used as wanted!
